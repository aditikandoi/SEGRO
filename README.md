# SEGRO
The idea behind the project is an end to end solution for waste segragation, collection and disposal.

The project aims to improve waste segragation and collection using smart bins fueled by machine learning, the code for which is Waste Master. The bin notifies the backend on being filled, which is hosted using Django The garbage collector is notified via a flutter app and a route optimization algorithm directs him to the various filled bins, after which the garbage is disposed.
